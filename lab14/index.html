				<h2>Debugging</h2>
				<p>I decided to debug lab 13, as I had an issue before where I couldn't get the lab to work without sacrificing the maximum case. <br>
				Essentially, if you did not place a maximum, it should print an error line saying "You did not provide a maximum." <br>
				In order to complete that lab, I had to remove that case, which is why it will work even without a maximum. <br>
				I was able to solve the problem by adding a {} bracket. I realized I was missing one squiggly bracket, which caused the entire thing to fail.
